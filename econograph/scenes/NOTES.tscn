8/22; Consider adding a game manager etc that enables the start/stop/fast forward of time. This would allow for control of the game state. Give the player an opportunity to read, pause and walk away, or move on to the next event more rapidly/experiment.
Additionally, to help graphically represent this idea, can implement simple sun/moon cycle that gives the player information at a glance for how quickly time is moving.  -kc

08/25; Spent some time reading on the WorldClock functions and how to build out a Player class. Ultimately made a few changes and a commit. See git log. -dm"
