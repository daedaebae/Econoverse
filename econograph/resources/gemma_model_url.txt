The model and the nobodywho addon was too large to commit to github so if you 
install nobody who addon from AssetLib, 
download this gguf model filefrom huggingface, put it in the resources folder, 
then attach it to the "NobodyWhoModel" and run the game it should work....
poorly <(^_^)>

I will probably roll this feature backe, but it was fun to experiment with AI 
in game!
